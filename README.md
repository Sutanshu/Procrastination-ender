# Procrastination-ender
Ever wanted to end your procrastination by limiting your time running applications? Try this. (MacOS only)
This program is based on individual preference for constant reminders of precious time being wasted away.
Ways to effectively use this:
  Run it from terminal by typing 'python appopener.py' in the right directory,
  Choose if you want a time limit, effectively choose yes by entering y and enter the duration of estimated use(seconds),
  Every 1/4th of total duration, there will be a pop-up reminding you to get productive,
  Effectively click on the fourth pop up (or less) and click on close window (be careful to save your work if needed).

Note: Not a guaranteed way to end procrastination, just a personal preference, that could help you. :)
